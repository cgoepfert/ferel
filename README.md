# Feature Relevance Bounds for Linear Classification (ferel)
We calculate bounds for the relevances of individual features for linear classification, based on minimal and maximal weights in the normal vectors that define _sensible_ separating hyperplanes.

For details, please see the corresponding publication [Feature Relevance Bounds for Linear Classification](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/2908201).

## Use
Import `ferel` and use `ferel.ferel.find_relevances(...)`. For more information and an example, please see [`demo.ipynb`](demo.ipynb).
